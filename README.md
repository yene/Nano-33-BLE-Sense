# Arduino NANO 33 BLE Sense

![Hardware Overview](material/Arduino-Nano-33-BLE-Sense-Hardware-Overview.jpg)

## FAQ
* Can it join Wi-Fi? No, it only does Bluetooth.
* Can you store data? No, the bootloader prevents access to the flash memory.
* Can it be used with micro/cicruit python?
* Is the word detection any good? Not really, does not have a high accuracy to be useful.

## Notes
* NANO 33 BLE comes with a microphone example: Arduino IDE -> Examples -> PDM -> PDMSerialPlotter.
* NANO 33 BLE is a 3.3V board.
* The 5V pin does not work, see the docs.
